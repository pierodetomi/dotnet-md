# Summary
**DotNetMd** is a simple tool for generating Markdown docs from .NET assemblies.

This tool works both by reading assembly information through reflection and by reading XML documentation files generated by the compiler.

The idea behind this tool is to provide a simple way to generate documentation for .NET assemblies in a format that can be easily shared and read by developers... with a friendly eye to my favorite documentation tool of choice: [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) :)

# Installation
**DotNetMd** is available as a [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PieroDeTomi.DotNetMd), but it's mainly intended to be used as a _dotnet tool_.

It can be installed as a global tool by running the following command:

```shell
dotnet tool install --global PieroDeTomi.DotNetMd
```

# Usage
Once installed, you can run the tool with the following command:

```shell
dotnetmd --config <path-to-config-file>
```

where `<path-to-config-file>` must be replaced with the path to the configuration file (see below for more information).

# Configuration
The configuration is a JSON file that must follow this structure:

| Property Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `assemblies` | `string[]` | Required | An array of paths to the assemblies to be documented |
| `outputPath` | `string` | Optional<br /><br />Default: `".\docs"` | The path to the output directory where the Markdown files will be generated |
| `outputStyle` | `"default" \| "microsoft"` | Optional<br /><br />Default: `"default"` | The "theme" that will be used to generate the documentation. `default` will use a default/simpler documentation style, while `microsoft` will use an output style similar to the one used by the Microsoft Docs |
| `shouldCreateNamespaceFolders` | `boolean` | Optional<br /><br />Default: `true` | If `true`, the tool will create a folder for each namespace in the output directory, and will place the generated Markdown files in the corresponding folder. If `false`, all the files will be placed in the root of the output directory |
| `isDocusaurusProject` | `boolean` | Optional<br /><br />Default: `false` | If `true`, the tool will include Docusaurus front-matter in the Markdown files and will generate `_category_.json` files inside the folders, in order to make the integration in a Docusaurus project some kind of "copy/paste" process. If `false`, nothing will change in the generation process |
